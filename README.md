# Shopping Cart Project

This is a shopping cart web application built using React. It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The data is fetched from the FakeStore API, and the application is styled with Styled Components. Unit and integration tests are written using React Testing Library with Vitest, and PropTypes are used for type checking. React Router handles the navigation between different pages.
